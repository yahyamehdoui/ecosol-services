                As an investor, Astrasun is interested in greenfield,
                ready-to-build and <br />
                turnkey renewable energy projects. We are willing to consider
                all
                <br /> opportunities. As business mediator, through our
                extensive partnerships, we <br />

                The nature of our land investments is real estate development,
                <br /> environmental rehabilitation and the enrichment of
                biodiversity. In some of
                <br /> our solar parks, we use an agrivoltaic model and we are
                preparing to <br />
                implement further demonstration projects in this field.
